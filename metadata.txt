description: Originally developed for natural language applications in 2017, transformers models have quickly shown their performance in many different tasks. The self-supervised approach proposed (eg masking for language model) allowed to train massive models that were shared by the community. This started a new era in deep learning where pre-trained models, trained on generic dataset, were applied with success in very various problems by organizations without the means to retain models from scratch.
