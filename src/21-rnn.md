## Recurrent Neural networks [GD]

### Principles

Why do we need RNN?
=> sequence processing

How does it work?
=> incremental "consumption" of sequential data and tracking with hidden state

### LSTM & GRU cells
### Architectures
### RNN Unfolding & bidirectional RNN
### Constraints and limitations
